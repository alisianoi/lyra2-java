> Lyra2 is a password hashing scheme (PHS) based on cryptographic
  sponges. It was designed to be strictly sequential (i.e. not
  easily parallelizable), to provide strong security even against
  attackers who use multiple processing cores (e.g. custom hardware
  or powerful GPUs). At the same time, it is very simple to implement
  in software and allows legitimate users to fine tune their memory and
  processing costs according to the desired level of security against
  brute force password guessing. Lyra2 is an improvement of the
  previously proposed Lyra algorithm which provides an even higher security
  level against different attack venues and overcomes some
  limitations of its predecessor and other existing schemes.

[Paper in the Cryptology ePrint Archive][2] and [a reference implementation in C][1] by:

*Marcos A. Simplicio Jr., Leonardo C. Almeida, Ewerton R. Andrade, Paulo C. F. dos Santos and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto*

This repository is a spin-off implementation in Java by me, Aleksandr Lisianoi, as part of my Bachelor's thesis at TU Wien.

# How to compile and run?
```
git clone https://github.com/alisianoi/lyra2-java.git
cd lyra2-java
mvn package
```

After maven packages the project, you can run it like so:

```
java -jar ./target/lyra2-*-with-dependencies.jar password salt 3 3 3
```

You can get help about command line switches with `--help`:

```
java -jar ./target/lyra2-*-with-dependencies.jar --help
```

# How to run tests?

```
mvn test
```

The unit tests cover three configurations of Lyra2:

1. Memory matrix of size `mcost * blocks * columns`, where:

   `mcost` is a dynamic parameter and `blocks = 12` and `columns = 256`

1. The `sponge`'s are set to either `blake2b`, `blamka` or `half round blamka`
1. For all sponges, `half-rounds = 12` and `full-rounds` depends on the sponge
1. The mode of Lyra2 operation is single-threaded

Note: every parameter, except for mode of operation, can be changed
(output length, `blocks`, `columns`, `half-rounds`, etc.) but you will
also have to provide a data file that would hold the correct hash for
that combination of parameters. See `tests/resources` for file format.

The resulting hash is byte-level compatible with the [original C
implementation][1]. It means that if you match the build- and runtime
parameters and supply the same password/salt and desired output
length, you will get the same hash as output.
